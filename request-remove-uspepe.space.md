Hello Phantom team,

Our website https://uspepe.space has been blocked in Phantom Wallet, but this appears to be a false positive.

USPEPE is a meme coin project on the Solana blockchain. We are currently conducting a presale, which requires users to connect their wallet in order to participate. However, at no point do we ask users for private keys, seed phrases, or any sensitive information.

âœ… Key facts:
- Wallet connection is only used to interact with our presale smart contract on Solana
- We do NOT request seed phrases or wallet keys
- HTTPS is enabled and enforced for secure access
- No malicious scripts, pop-ups, or redirects are present
- Risk warnings related to meme coin volatility and crypto investments are clearly displayed

We are committed to transparency, security, and protecting our community.  
We kindly request that Phantom reviews this listing and considers removing uspepe.space from the blocklist.

Please let us know if any additional information is needed. Weâ€™d be happy to provide it.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,  
USPEPE Team
